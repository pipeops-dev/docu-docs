# Deploying Flask on PipeOps

Deploying your Flask applications on PipeOps is a breeze, thanks to its robust support. In this guide, you'll discover just how effortless it is to deploy your project.

## Getting Started

For a quick and hassle-free start, clone our pre-built Flask template from [here](https://github.com/pipeops-dev/pipeops-flask). This template includes a Dockerfile that will be utilized during deployment. If you already have a project to deploy, create a Dockerfile and copy the relevant information from our Flask template Dockerfile into your project's Dockerfile.

Here's an example Dockerfile based on our Flask template:

```dockerfile
# Set the base image to Python 3.9
FROM python:3.11.0
# Set environment variables
ENV PYTHONUNBUFFERED 1
ENV PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE 1
# Set the working directory to /app
WORKDIR /app
# Copy the requirements file into the container and install dependencies
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt
# Copy the application code into the container
COPY . .
# Expose port 5000 for the Flask application
EXPOSE 5000
# Start the Flask development server
CMD ["python", "manage.py", "0.0.0.0:5000"]
```

## Deploy Your Project

Assuming you have completed our [get started guide](/docs/User%20Guides/For%20Developers/dev-account-setup), but if not, proceed to connect your PipeOps account to your preferred git provider and select your project. In the image below, you'll find the necessary configurations for your Django project. After completing these configurations, click on the "Deploy Project" button to initiate the deployment.
