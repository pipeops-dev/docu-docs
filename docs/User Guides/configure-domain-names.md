# Configuring Domain Names 
# Welcome your visitors to a personalized, branded experience

Enhance your project's identity by assigning a custom domain. A custom domain allows you to utilize a domain name that reflects your brand, rather than a generic URL provided by PipeOps. This helps convey to your visitors that they have reached the correct destination and fosters trust in your brand.

### Default Domain

By default, every newly created Project will automatically receive its own subdomain assigned to Production Deployments, ending in antqube.io. You can find it below your Project's name on the Project list.

This default Domain is provided free of charge forever and is auto-generated for your project. You have the option to keep it as the main way for visitors to access your application or choose to remove it in the future.

You can also edit the default domain name to suit your preferences.

### Custom Domain

To use a custom domain name instead of the default subdomain provided by PipeOps, follow these steps:

1. Go to the "Settings" tab of your project in the PipeOps dashboard.
2. Navigate to the "General Settings" section.
3. Follow the prompts to add your desired custom domain name.

If you don't already own a custom domain, be sure to purchase one first.

By configuring your own domain, you can provide a more personalized and branded experience for your visitors.
